# F1 Race Insights Platform - Architecture

## Overview

This project utilizes a **serverless architecture** on AWS to process, store, and visualize Formula 1 race data fetched from the FastF1 API. The architecture is designed to be highly scalable, cost-effective, and resilient, leveraging AWS Lambda for compute and DynamoDB for fast, NoSQL data storage.

## Key Components

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- **AWS Lambda**: Lambda functions are used to trigger API calls to the FastF1 API after race sessions. The Lambda functions are scheduled using **Amazon EventBridge**, which ensures data is fetched post-session.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Triggers the Lambda function based on race session schedules (e.g., after each Formula 1 race event).

### 2. **Data Storage**
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Used to store race session data, including lap times, driver stats, sector times, and tire information. DynamoDB is chosen for its flexibility in handling varying data structures and scalability.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing static files (images, JSON, etc.) related to race sessions.

### 3. **API Layer**
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Acts as the API layer, exposing RESTful endpoints for querying race and driver data. Each API call is routed to the appropriate Lambda function that fetches or processes data from DynamoDB.
  
### 4. **Frontend and Distribution**
- **React.js & Chart.js**: Create a web dashboard to display race data, stats and visualisations
- **Amazon S3 & CloudFront**: The web-based front-end dashboard is hosted in S3 and distributed globally via CloudFront for low-latency access. Users can interact with the data through a user-friendly interface.

### 5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- The entire architecture is managed using **AWS CloudFormation** (or **Terraform**), ensuring that all resources can be deployed automatically and consistently across environments.

## Scalability
- **Lambda Auto-Scaling**: AWS Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming API requests and data ingestion jobs.
- **DynamoDB Auto-Scaling**: DynamoDB scales dynamically to handle the varying loads generated by querying race data.

## Security, Monitoring & Logging
- **AWS IAM**: Implement IAM Roles and Policies for Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to ensure least-privileged access.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Used for logging, monitoring, and alerting across Lambda functions and API Gateway. CloudWatch Logs track each invocation and any errors, while CloudWatch Alarms notify of any performance issues or downtime.

  
## Future Enhancements
- Adding predictive analytics with **AWS SageMaker** to forecast driver performance based on historical data.
- Implementing **authentication** via AWS Cognito for user access control.
- Integrate AWS WAF with API Gateway for added security.
